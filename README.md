# The Carpentries Community Service Awards

The Carpentries Community Service Award is a way for the Executive Council to recognize work
which, in its opinion, significantly improves the project.
The intention of these awards is to demonstrate that service to our community does lead to recognition and reward,
rather than to provide a direct incentive to contributors.
Recognition will take the form of an award certificate plus a public announcement.
